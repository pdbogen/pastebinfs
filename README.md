pastebinfs
==========

Fuse module for talking to Pastebin.com, implemented in Perl.

TODO
====

Pastebin API doesn't properly support modifying files or changing things like 
the title. That's a bummer. These need to be implemented as full-class calls to 
the web interface, which is eminently doable, if evil. I'll get to it.
